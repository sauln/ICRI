# TODO


## Big
- [x] revert the algo so it uses all of the last vehicles to find next rather than
just the most recent
- [ ] incorporate *robustness* of solution into the cost function
- [ ] integrate changing hyperparameters (delta) into loop
- [ ] more sophisticated method for choosing between possible solutions w/ delta
- [ ] incorporate stopping conditions into algo 2
- [ ] build soft timewindows into algo
- [ ] make it faster - there are tons of opportunity for caching and short circuiting
- [ ] 


## Smaller
- [x] numpyify code - lots of very naive implementations - put more operations into 
numpy language to speed up.
- [x] get this task list to render (extensions/tasklist.md?)
- [ ] make Parameters::customers return a shallow copy on `get`
