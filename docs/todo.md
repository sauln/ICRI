# TODO

- [ ] how parameters should be used
- [x] about singleton vs global for parameters
- [ ] incorporate *robustness* of solution into the cost function
- [ ] integrate changing hyperparameters (delta) into loop
- [ ] sophisticated methods for modifying hyperparameters?
- [ ] incorporate stopping conditions into algo 2
- [ ] build soft timewindows into algo
- [ ] numpyify code - lots of very naive implementations - put more operations into 
numpy language to speed up.
-  * matrices build
- [x] get this task list to render (extensions/tasklist.md?)
- [ ] make Parameters::customers return a shallow copy on `get`
- [ ] fix getBestNNodes so it''s faster
