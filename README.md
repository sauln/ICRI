==============================

Prototype for the ICRI algorithm found in 

> Figliozzi,  M. A.  An  Iterative  Route  Construction  and  Improvement
> Algorithm for the Vehicle Routing Problem with Soft-Time Windows.
> Transportation Research Part C,
> Vol. 18, No. 5, pp. 668–679.


Intent is to develop a stochastic generalization of the problem and apply it specifically to the  B-line freight bicycle routing.

Run current tests and demonstration of capabilities with 
$./run_problem.sh r101
