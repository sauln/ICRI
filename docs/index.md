# Welcome to blineVRP 

## TODO
* clean up code - simplify - cut out all the cleverness
* bring back singleton for preprocessing distances



## Summary
This repository will both serve as a

* foundation for future research on stochastic generalizations of the problem and 
* to apply the solutions to real applicatoins, potentially for freight bicycle routing

Prototype for the ICRI algorithm found in 
 > Figliozzi,  M. A.  An  Iterative  Route  Construction  and  Improvement Algorithm for the Vehicle Routing Problem with Soft-Time Windows. Transportation Research Part C, Vol. 18, No. 5, pp. 668â€“679.

## Installation

`git clone http://github.com/sauln/ICRI.git`

`pip install requirements.txt`

## Commands

* `./run_program.sh` - Run current bleeding edge; tests, routing for r101, and visualization
